<h3>Karen Whitney, Director, Community Planning and Development, Planning and Economic Development Branch, Corporate Services, York Region</h3>

<h4>Oct 16th, 2019</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<h5>Comments Regarding Transportation Safety in Public Areas:</h5>
<li>Pedestrian and cyclist safety is very important</li>
<li>Suggested that when it comes to transportation, the old mentality of “how do we get cars moving” 
	should change to “how do we get people moving” would include people getting to where they need to go, 
	by other means such as walking, cycling, public transit etc.</li>
<li>Stated that one of the problems with safety on the road is distracted driving</li>
<li>New planning focus for cities is to design safer cities by providing more open and welcoming areas in the city</li>
<h5>Ideas Karen Whitney Listed for the Future:</h5>
<li>Waste will go to energy power plants, not to landfills</li>
<li>Providing affordable housing</li>
<li>Ways to move people not cars</li>
<li>Stormwater management</li>
<li>Safety to design</li>
<h5>How Karen Whitney’s comments are related to our solution:</h5>
<li>Ensuring accessible parking for those who need it promotes safety for those individuals because they can park 
	and have less distance to travel, rather than parking further away and risking injury</li>
</ul>
 <br>
 <br>
<h3>Craig Lane, Architect, HCMA Architecture and Design in Vancouver, Canada</h3>

<h4>Nov 1st, 2019</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<h5>Problems with public spaces:</h5>
<li>Craig Lane got us thinking about whether people care about public spaces these days given everything is 
	accessible through technology</li>
<li>He suggested the questions we should be asking ourselves “Is there something different about public spaces 
	than online and how do we create a public space accessible for everyone?”</li>
<li>He said it was important to encourage people to use public spaces</li>
<li>Buildings and public spaces should be fully accessible</li>
<li>Why is it more effective when people see each other face-to-face?</li>
<li>Higher quality meetings when people interact in person</li>
<li>Mr. Lane thinks that we must make public spaces more accessible and inclusive because this may be a 
reason that people are not using public spaces as frequently as before</li>
<li>We must think about placemaking (management of public spaces) and inclusivity</li>
<li>Big question: “How do we get people to come to public spaces?”</li>
<h5>How Craig Lane's Feedback Related to our Solution:</h5>
<li>Based on what Mr. Lane said about making public spaces more accessible, it will encourage people in the 
	community to get out of the house and be active</li>
<li>Our accessible parking solution achieves this goal by ensuring that people with disabilities have access to 
	close parking in public spaces</li>
</ul>

<h3>John Zelek, Associate Professor and Co-Director of the VIP (Vision Image Processing) Lab, Ontario, Canada</h3>

<h4>Nov 7th, 2019</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<h5>Issues that occur within public spaces to look into:</h5>
<li>Pedestrians unaware of bikers coming</li>
<li>People getting stuck in their car during snowstorms</li>
<li>Snowbanks on side of road taking up space that could be used for parking</li>
<li>High amount of energy use when heating and cooling buildings</li>
<li>Housing for most people is expensive</li>
<li>Air pollution at major intersections left in the air</li>
<h5>Ideas that John Zelek listed for the future:</h5>
<li>Vertical green walls on building</li>
<li>Collecting crime data from 311 service</li>
<li>Sound emitting sensor for bikers to detect pedestrians crossing the road</li>
<li>App that locates where homeless people are</li>
<h5>How John  Zelek’s comments are related to our solution:</h5>
<li>Encouraged us to potentially use the data collection to allow property owners to optimize number of 
	accessibility stalls in parking lots</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Kim Huntley, Manager of North York Central Library</h3>

<h4>Nov 11th, 2019</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<h5>Topics discussed:</h5>
<li>Ms. Huntley discussed the topic of how libraries can stay relevant</li>
<li>She told us that something might be relevant right now, but in the near future, it could not be relevant, 
	due to the quick advancements made in technology</li>
<h5>Importance of libraries in communities:</h5>
<li>“How to keep libraries relevant?”</li>
<li>Libraries are part of the Social Structure</li>
<li>Depending on the libraries’ locations, different book collections and programs are offered to that relate to 
	the community’s needs. For example, newcomers to Canada go to the library as one of the first stops to learn 
	about the community services</li>
<li>Libraries are offering more STEM activities such as 3D Printing</li>
<h5>How Kim Huntley’s comments are related to our solution:</h5>
<li>Told us that the library provides services to people with disabilities who are unable to leave their homes</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Eda Conte-Pitcher, Library Service Manager of North York Central Library</h3>

<h4>Nov 11th, 2019</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<h5>Eda Conte-Pitchers’s thoughts on the importance of libraries in communities:</h5>
<li>Everyone’s needs should be balanced</li>
<li>A library is considered a “third space” (First space, your home. Second space, your school/work)</li>
<li>The main point of libraries is to support people to make them successful</li>
<li>Gives people access to certain equipment for activities that are not available at their homes</li>
<li>One of the most important issues in libraries are not enough seats to account for the number of people using
	the space</li>
<h5>How Eda Conte-Pitcher’s comments are related to our solution:</h5>
<li>She talked about there needs to be more accessibility for families with young children in strollers</li>
<li>Ensuring better accessibility for parking solutions at the public library will encourage people with 
	disabilities to leave their homes and visit the library</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Brenda Vrkljan, Professor, Occupational Therapy, McMaster University</h3>

<h4>Nov 14th, 2019</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<h5>Importance of driving for the disabled and seniors:</h5>
<li>Provides independence for those with disabilities and seniors to keeps them active and active members of the 
	community</li>
<li>Driving is important, especially for people with disabilities because they cannot walk or cycle and access 
	public transit</li>
<li>Seniors that stay home will suffer from mental health issues and have shorter lifespans</li>
<h5>Ideas that Brenda Vrkljan listed for the future:</h5>
<li>Solution that allows accessible parking to be available for people in need</li>
<li>Creating something that encourages seniors to do something</li>
<li>Avoid shaming people with a buzzer</li>
<li>Potentially scare people nearby</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>William Wiles, Parking Operations Supervisor at York University</h3>

<h4>Nov 17th, 2019</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<h5>Things William Wiles pointed out:</h5>
<li>Province gives accessibility parking permit that can be issued by a number of professions</li>
<li>Seniors sometimes forget to display their permit</li>
<li>People who park illegally don't go to court</li>
<li>Permits are issued based on mobility</li>
<li>Seniors are eligible for permits but choose not to get them because they let people who have disabilities get 
	them</li>
<li>10% of parking spaces have to be for priority parking in Toronto</li>
<li>People forget to renew the permit</li>
<li>P/D = Passenger and driver</li>
<li>People take advantage of their permit, as in some places they can get free parking</li>
<li>Each city all have zoning bylaw</li>
<h5>Ideas from William that he listed for the future:</h5>
<li>Seniors would go out more if they had good parking close to the entrance of the place</li>
<li>Some people park on fire routes</li>
<li>Make sure people don't take the permit for advantage</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Adamo Donatucci, Regional Vice-President of Park Indigo Canada</h3>

<h4>Nov 18th, 2019</h4>
<br>
<ul>
<h5>Some things Adamo Donatucci pointed out:</h5>
<li>Cameras take pictures of the license</li>
<li>Easy to put up display screen for spots</li>
<li>His company would be willing to test out our project</li>
<li>Permits allow free street parking</li>
<li>He likes the warning system</li>
<li>No other solution than a gate that raises and lowers which is highly ineffective</li>
<li>This is a big issue at hospitals</li>
<li>Might stress seniors to get permit out quickly</li>
<li>Identifying plate that doesn't have a permit to fine the person</li>
<h5>Ideas Adamo listed for the future:</h5>
<li>We need to make something if someone backs into the spot</li>
<li>Try to make sure repeat offenders are very common</li>
