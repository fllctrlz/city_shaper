		<h2>Design Process</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		When designing our base robot, we establish criteria at the outset, such as desired footprint, height,
		balance, drive train, sensors to be used, user interface, etc. to arrive at a working prototype. 
		We also strive to design and build a base robot which is robust and which features a frame around 
		the chassis to provide structural rigidity as well as means to square up against walls and mission models. 
		We design attachments keeping in mind that these attachments need to be easy to install and remove, 
		robust, and both passive and multi-purpose whenever possible. 
		From testing the prototype base robot and the attachments, we make revisions to our work in order 
		to combine and speed up missions and increase repeatability to achieve maximum efficiency, 
		through completion time and size. By the end of the season, our attachments will often be in their fifth or sixth iteration.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our robot is very robust and compact with a frame for strength. We use three light sensors and a gyro sensor for maximum
			flexibility,
			with shielding from ambient light. Our robot has small guide wheels on the back, which are steering neutral, and small sized wheels with a small diameter.
			These small wheels allow for more accurate movements as they decrease the error associated with the drive motor rotation sensors.
			However, we sacrifice some speed due to our wheels having a small diameter.

		<h2>Examples of Robotic Testing Conducted by Ctrl-Z </h2>
		<br>
		<h4>Finding the Optimal Set of Color Sensors for our Robot</h4>
		<p>When first designing our robot we wanted to make sure that all the light/color sensors behaved similarly.
			Color
			sensors each return small differences in readings because of variations in manufacturing. For example, if
			you were to place
			two different color sensors on the same black line, each would return different values for light intensity.
			Sometimes
			the difference may be significant. To make sure that all our light sensors had about the same reading we
			completely
			shielded ten color sensors to eliminate the variable of ambient light and recorded the reading for each of
			the color sensors
			on black and white. We then found the three color sensors which have the closest reading to each
			other and used
			those three color sensors on the robot.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Making the Robot Drive Straight</h4>
		<p>We have found that the move functions provided by the EV3 Python suite are unreliable. Although they have
			a
			built in PID feature, they still do not move the robot in a straight line. To test this, we set a designated
			starting spot
			for the robot and then we ran it until it hit the wall on the other side of the table. We repeated this
			dozens of times
			and found that each time it would end up in a different spot on the other side of the table. Each time it
			would be up to
			an inch away from the previous run. Then, we made our own error-corrected movement function (which you can read
			about in the
			programming section of this website). We conducted the same experiment using our block and found that there
			was much less error
			and the robot would consistently end up in the same position on the table.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Light Sensor Distance Experiment</h4>
		<p>Our light sensors were dependent on the distance they were away from the mat. We found out that our light
			sensors
			were too low to the mat and were not picking up proper light readings. We used the EV3 experiment which can
			track the
			different movements on the motors and sensors. We tracked the readings to see if they would change properly
			from white to
			black; 100 to 0. They did not reach those values so we realized it was too far from the mat.

					<td class="tick-border">Traffic Jam</td>
					<td class="tick-border">
						This is our simplest attachment and consists of a single multi-purpose arm connected
						to the D motor. The robot uses it to life the Traffic Jam mission halfway. Then, the
						robot pivots to completely raise the Traffic Jam. The robot then pivots until it detects
						the white, then black, then white line. The robot then uses PID line following to drive
						by the Swing, where a flexible tube on the robot releases the Swing. Next, the robot
						pivots north and drives until it detects a white line. The arm is moved to the left side
						and the robot stops in front of the Elevator. The arm swings the elevator into scoring
						position. The robot then pivots and drives toward the Steel Construction mission where
						it squares up to the mission model. The arm is used to raise the Steel Construction into
						scoring position.

					<td class="tick-border">Craney</td>
					<td class="tick-border">
						This attachment is used to drop the Hooked Blue Unit onto the Blue Unit within the Blue Circle.
						It is pushed into the Crane where a beam pushes the lever to swing the Crane and the Blue Unit
						is pushed into the Blue Circle. A tall wall lines up with the Hooked Blue Unit while another
						beam pushes the lever to release the string, dropping the Hooked Blue Unit onto the Blue
						Unit in the Blue Circle.

					<td class="tick-border">Red Circle</td>
					<td class="tick-border">
						This attachment is a small frame with a lift arm controlled by the D motor. The robot carries
						a variety of units from the Design and Build mission, and from the Innovative Architecture
						mission. The robot takes these units to the Red Circle where the lift arm is raised, releasing
						the units. The robot then positions itself to drive up the ramp. By spinning the D motor in the
						opposite direction, the attachment is released from the robot, allowing the robot to climb the ramp more easily.
						The robot then drives up the ramp.

						This attachment pushes 3 beams down at the Safety Factor mission model. The robot pushes
						the attachment into Safety Factor. A funnel is used to perfectly line up the attachment.
						Beams are used to push two lateral supports and an elastic-band powered arm pushes a third
						support in the middle. This also locks the attachment onto the mission model which is left behind
						when the robot backs up.
